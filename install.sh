#   curl -fsSL https://bax.bot/install.sh | bash

# It checks prerequisites, clones Baxter, puts the `baxter` CLI on your PATH, and
# scaffolds app/.env -- then hands off. It does NOT start Baxter (needs a Discord
# token + a model key you supply) and does NOT install Docker (it checks + points
# you at the docs). Safe to re-run: an existing Baxter checkout is updated in place,
# and a filled-in app/.env is never overwritten.
#
# Install into a custom directory (default ~/baxter):
#   curl -fsSL https://bax.bot/install.sh | bash -s -- /opt/baxter
#   BAXTER_DIR=/opt/baxter  curl -fsSL https://bax.bot/install.sh | bash
#
# NOTE: this file is `bootstrap.sh` in the repo; bax.bot serves its contents at
# /install.sh -- re-upload after editing. (The repo's own `install.sh` is a
# different, post-clone helper that only symlinks the CLI onto PATH.)
#

${B}Next steps${Z} -- set one thing, then Baxter takes it from there:

  1. Give Baxter a model -- it needs a brain before it can help with anything else.
     Get an ${B}OpenRouter API key${Z} (https://openrouter.ai, the default) and set
     ${B}OPENROUTER_API_KEY${Z} in ${B}$DEST/app/.env${Z}.
  2. Run ${B}baxter shell${Z} and ask Baxter to finish setting up -- it walks you
     through the Discord bot token and the rest, and writes it in for you.

If 'baxter' isn't found, add its bin dir to PATH (the CLI installer noted it above).
Full setup -- other model backends, the optional mail/voice surfaces -- is in
$DEST/README.md.
